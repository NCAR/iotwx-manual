# Flashing Microcontrollers

Each station node is build atop a microcontroller, where each
microcontroller is connected to one or more sensors either directly or
by [Grove hubs](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-I2C-Hub.html). 

IotWx is designed to be used with the [m5Stack Atom Lite](https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-core/products/atom-lite-esp32-development-kit)
ESP32-Pico based microcontroller.  

There are two nodes that the core Arduino code has been developed for.
Before compiling the microcode onto the Arduino, you will also need to
install the core IoTwx shared library which controls many of the
communications and initialization functions of each node.

This core library can found at the following repository. It should be
installed in your `Arduiono/libraries` directory and once installed, you
may use it by the `#include "IoTwx.h"` directive.

Please see the
[parts list](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lAb784yfsxWOiH-yVCXQ3Ii0yEgUmtUQ/view?usp=sharing)
for the microcontroller, sensors and cables required or recommended to
build and connect a base system.

## Preparing Your System

You will need to install the [latest version of Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) on your system to begin.

There are a few other steps you will need to complete:

* install the required ESP32 Pico / M5 Stack Atom lite boards; a comprehensive instruction set is [here](https://docs.m5stack.com/#/en/arduino/arduino_development)
* install the [arduino-esp32fs-plugin](https://github.com/me-no-dev/arduino-esp32fs-plugin) that will allow SPIFFS file uploads to ESP32 boards
* install the following libraries through the Arduino IDE:
  * MQTT library from 256dpi [https://github.com/256dpi/arduino-mqtt](https://github.com/256dpi/arduino-mqtt)
  * SeeedStudio VEML6070 library [https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_VEML6070](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_VEML6070)
  * SeeedStudio BME280 library [https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Grove_BME280](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Grove_BME280)
  * SeeedStudio BME680 library [https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_BME680](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_BME680)
  * ArduinoJson library [https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson)
  * FastLED library [https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED)
  * NTPClient library [https://github.com/arduino-libraries/NTPClient](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/NTPClient)

## Editing and Flashing Configuration Files

Each node must contain a configuration file in order to operate.  The file contains information about WiFi connections, MQTT connections and some information about the node.



We are using the [ESP32 SPIFFS filesystem](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/storage/spiffs.html) to store the configuration.  In the repositories of each node, you will find a `data` folder which contains a `config.json` file.



### `config.json` details

The typical config file  follows:

```json
{    
    "iotwx_local_config":"1",
    "iotwx_id":"m5atom/esp32/aaffbbcc",
    "iotwx_mq_ip":"",
    "iotwx_mq_port":"1883",
    "iotwx_publish_interval":"1",
    "iotwx_reset_interval":"360",
    "iotwx_sensor":"grove/i2c",
    "iotwx_timezone":"21600",
    "iotwx_wifi_pwd":"",
    "iotwx_wifi_ssid":"",
    "iotwx_topic":"measurements/iotwx",
    "iotwx_max_frequency":"240"
}
```

* `iotwx_local_config` should always be set to `1`.

* `iotwx_id` should contain a _unique_ identifier for you station as a whole -- that is to say, if you have multiple nodes on the same _physical station_, they would share the same `iotwx_id`.  This identifier is also used in the data portal.

* `iotwx_mq_ip` contains the ip address (e.g. `''172.88.0.13"`) of the MQTT broker you will be using.  At the moment only one such broker is allowed. You may use the FQDN (`"mymqttsite.wx"`) but the IP address uses less power by reducing the time WiFi is on to do DNS lookups.

* `iotwx_mq_port` contains the port number of the broker, which is typically `"1883"`.

* `iotwx_publish_interval` contains the interval you wish your station to transmit in _minutes_.  Note this is relevant primarily for the Atmos node which continuously transmits at the specified interval. Hydro and Aero nodes only transmit when there is data to transmit.

* `iotwx_reset_interval` is the number of minutes between system resets.  The nodes are designed to reset every 6 hours or twice daily.  Reset is instantaneous and the system is restored to full functionality in 90 seconds after the Bluetooth acquisition phase.

* `iotwx_sensor` is the sensor string for the node and may vary based on the node.  Typically do not change this value from what is contained in the default for your node.

* `iotwx_timezone` is the GMT offset in seconds of the station timezone.

* `iotwx_wifi_pwd` and `iotwx_wifi_ssid` are the corresponding wifi password and ssid of the network your node will connect to.  Note, it is not necessary (but would be unusual) for all nodes to connect to the same WiFi network.

* `iotwx_topic` contains the MQTT topic your node will publish to.  It is not necessary for all nodes to publish to the same topic, but if you are using the CHORDS MQTT Orchestrator ([GitHub - NCAR/chords-mqtt-orchestrator](https://github.com/NCAR/chords-mqtt-orchestrator)), then you will need to adjust it accordingly to route your messages where they belong.  The current default is `"measurements/iotwx"`

* `iotwx_max_frequency` is the CPU frequency (in Mhz) you wish your node to run  on.  The m5Stack Atom Lite can be run at frequencies up to 240, but has only been tested down 40 Mhz.  The AeroNode must be set to above `"160"` and runs best at `"240"`.  The Hydro node has been successfully configured at `"40"`  and the Atmos node's best performance is at `"80"`.  Varying the value has power-saving benefits, where we have seen 20-50% reduction in power consumption of a node.



## Atmos Node

The Atmos node is comprised of two sensors and two 3d-printed housing
units. The first sensor houses the atmospheric conditions for air
temperature, humidity and barometric pressure. It can be fitted with the
[Seeedstudio BME280 Grove](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-BME280-Environmental-Sensor-Temperature-Humidity-Barometer.html)
environmental sensor, or if you would like to obtain aggregate VOC
measurements, you can fit the housing with the
[BME680 Grove](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Temperature-Humidity-Pressure-and-Gas-Sensor-for-Arduino-BME680.html)
sensor. The code is designed to work with both sensors (but not
simultaneously). These parts can be found in the
[parts list](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lAb784yfsxWOiH-yVCXQ3Ii0yEgUmtUQ/view?usp=sharing).

### Radiation Shield

The radiation shield sensor captures the following measurements:
temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, and optionally VOC (if using
the BME680 sensor).

**PRINTING**

* the radiation shield design 3d print files can be found in the
  [`/build/stl/atmos`](https://github.com/NCAR/iotwx-manual/tree/master/build/stl/atmos) page. If you need to
  print, you will need to follow the instructions there to print the
  housing.

**FLASHING**

* the code to flash the node can be found in the
  [esp32-atomlite-arduino-atmos-node repository](https://github.com/NCAR/esp32-atomlite-arduino-atmos-node).
  You will to follow the instructions there to understand the Arduino
  flashing requirements and procedures.

### UV

Because the UV measurement is part of the Atmos node, the code already
includes the capability to capture and transmit measurements. It is
integrated in to the
[esp32-atomlite-arduino-atmos-node repository](https://github.com/NCAR/esp32-atomlite-arduino-atmos-node)
and hence no other changes or files are necessary to flash once that
file has been uploaded to the microcontroller.

## Hydro Node

<img width="360" alt="hydro node"
src="https://github.com/NCAR/iotwx-manual/blob/main/img/hydro-node.jpg"/>

The hydro node is designed to collected and transmit precipitation
measurements.  

**PRINTING** 

* the rain gauge design 3d print files can be found in the
  [`/build/stl/hydro`](https://github.com/NCAR/iotwx-manual/tree/master/build/stl/hydro)
  page. If you need to print, you will need to follow the instructions
  there to print the housing.

**FLASHING**

* the code to flash the node can be found in the
  [esp32-atomlite-arduino-hydro-node repository](https://github.com/NCAR/esp32-atomlite-arduino-hydro-node).

The aero node is designed to collect wind vane & anemometer wind speed
and direction.

* Instructions for printing and flashing are forthcoming.
