**PARTS LIST**

Before getting started, you should consult the complete list of parts
and hardware that can be found at:

* See the
  [Google spreadsheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lAb784yfsxWOiH-yVCXQ3Ii0yEgUmtUQ/view?usp=sharing)
  for the full, up-to-date list of _non-printed_ parts for building a
  complete station. The vast majority of parts can be found on Amazon,
  through online electronics distributors and through your local
  hardware store.

**Note:** the base case build has quantities preset to 1 item. Also,
**alternative power options** are also listed in this document for users
interested in further customizing their station to specific power needs.

If you only wish to do tabletop testing, you will only need to follow
the [flash instructions](https://github.com/NCAR/iotwx-manual/tree/master/flash) for the microcontroller and then proceed to
the [tabletop testing](#skeletontabletop-testing). This will eliminate
the need for making wiring bundles, constructing a PVC frame or printing
the 3d-printed housing.

## 3D-Printing

All parts can be found in the [stl](./stl) folder and in conjection 
with the station assembly instructions.

Reference stations have been produced with PLA+ material, but
ABS and other materials may be used, provided you have 
enough expertise using them.



## Framing


## Wiring


## Station Assembly

You can find the various assembly instructions in the provided PDF files:

* [Aero Node Assembly](./NCAR_AERO_Node_Assembly_Doc.pdf) instruction set
* [Hydro Node Assembly](./NCAR_HYDRO_Node_Assembly_Doc.pdf) instruction set
* [Atmos Node Assembly](./NCAR_ATMOS_Node_Assembly_Doc.pdf) instruction set

This is a community driven project, if you would like to contribute proposed changes to the assembly instructions or see other issues please submit it via [New Issues]( https://github.com/NCAR/iotwx-manual/issues)
