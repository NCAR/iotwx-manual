# STL files for printing

There are directories containing all the STL files necessary to print the 
station.  The following nodes are available for printing.  Please consult
the [parts list](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hnn0Ms2DzVQgRFmGBpLQ9W2NGEz2gopc/view?usp=sharing) and [flash instructions](https://github.com/ClimateChangeXplorers/xplorer-manual/tree/master/flash) for the other parts (electronics, etc.) 
and code that are necessary to construct a fully operational node.

* [atmos node files](./atmos) are available for the radiation shield
* [hydro node files](./hydro) are available for the tipping bucket
* [aero node files](./aero) are available for the wind vane and anemometer 
* [solar assembly files](./solar) are available for the solar panel assembly
* [pvc connectors files](./pvc) are available for the pvc connectors


# Acknowledgements

This design would not have been possible without the enumerable contributions of others.

In particular, the Atmos node is inspired by the work of the [3D-PAWS radiation shield assembly](https://sites.google.com/ucar.edu/3dpaws/instruments/radiation-shield) ((c) UCAR/COMET)
from which modifications were made to accommodate different sensor orientations, to allow
for easier insertion of the leaf screens and changes were made to the shaft for 
improved threading and durability. The Hydro node is remixed and modified from the 
original work of [RobWLake's LTB Weather Station](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2849562) 
(CC-BY-NC 4.0) -- changes were made to the sensor holder to accommodate a [Grove hall effect sensor](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Hall_Sensor/) and a debris screen, 
as well as sizing modifications so that it is easier to construct.
