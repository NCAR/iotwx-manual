# IoTwx Manual

The process for building your station follows 5 major steps:

1. [PLAN](/plan): in this step you will plan out the design of your
   station. The components, sensors, physical design, etc. will all be
   taken into account during this phase.
2. [BUILD](./build): in this step you will begin the building process.
   You will gather your frame parts, wires, and PVC and build the frame
   so it is ready for your sensors and microcontrollers.
3. [FLASH](./flash): in this step you will build the source files and
   flash them onto your device. Should you want to flash the binaries
   directly, there are instructions to do so.
4. [TEST](./test): making sure each node works as expected will insure
   the best experience for your deployment.
5. [DEPLOY](./deploy): siting and deploying are the final step in
   getting you on your way to your first 3d-printed automated weather
   station.
