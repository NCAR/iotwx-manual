# Planning Your Station Build & Deployment

In general, planning your station is easy. While we recommend you use PVC for the 
main frame of the station, you may use any materials you like as long as they bind to 
the ABS/PLA plastic of the 3D-printed parts.

The base configuration of the station includes three nodes and the power (we'll 
consider the power a node as well moving forward).  You may reduce or expand those 
nodes based on your specific needs, but the base configuration will be assumed in 
this guide.
